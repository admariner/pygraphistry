# GFQL Hypergraph Opts Validation Improvements

## Current Status
Working on PR #753: Improve hypergraph opts parameter validation

### Branch
`feature/gfql-hypergraph-opts-validation`

## Completed Tasks
1. ✅ Investigated hypergraph opts structure in HyperBindings class
2. ✅ Created comprehensive validation function `validate_hypergraph_opts()`
3. ✅ Added 19 tests for opts validation in `test_hypergraph_opts_validation.py`
4. ✅ Updated documentation in `docs/source/gfql/builtin_calls.rst` to be more precise about opts structure
5. ✅ Committed and pushed documentation improvements
6. ✅ Added hypergraph method signature to Plottable Protocol
7. ✅ Fixed untyped getattr usage in call_executor.py - now uses direct method call
8. ✅ Fixed circular import between Plottable and HypergraphResult using TYPE_CHECKING
9. ✅ Reverted mypy.ini to Python 3.8 (CI tests multiple versions)
10. ✅ All tests pass in Docker: 19 passed in test_hypergraph_opts_validation.py

## All Issues Resolved
✅ Fixed CI docs build failure (RST syntax error)
✅ Fixed typing issues (hypergraph method, circular import)
✅ Enhanced opts validation with comprehensive tests

## Investigation Findings
1. `hypergraph` method is defined in `PlotterBase` class (PlotterBase.py:2655)
2. `PlotterBase` extends `Plottable` Protocol
3. `Plottable` is a Protocol in Plottable.py but doesn't declare hypergraph method
4. `hypergraph` returns `HypergraphResult` (TypedDict with entities, events, edges, nodes, graph)

## Summary
PR #753 is complete and ready for review. All planned improvements have been implemented:

1. **Enhanced validation** - Created `validate_hypergraph_opts()` with proper nested structure checking
2. **Comprehensive testing** - 19 tests covering all validation scenarios
3. **Fixed typing** - Added hypergraph to Plottable Protocol, removed getattr
4. **Documentation** - Updated with precise type information and examples
5. **CI passing** - Fixed RST syntax issues, all checks green

## Commands to Run
```bash
# For typechecking
WITH_BUILD=0 WITH_LINT=0 WITH_TYPECHECK=1 WITH_TEST=0 ./test-cpu-local-minimal.sh

# For testing specific test file
WITH_BUILD=0 WITH_LINT=0 WITH_TYPECHECK=0 WITH_TEST=1 ./test-cpu-local-minimal.sh graphistry/tests/compute/test_hypergraph_opts_validation.py
```

## Files Modified
- `graphistry/compute/gfql/call_safelist.py` - Added validate_hypergraph_opts()
- `graphistry/tests/compute/test_hypergraph_opts_validation.py` - New test file
- `docs/source/gfql/builtin_calls.rst` - Enhanced documentation
- `graphistry/Plottable.py` - Added hypergraph method signature to Protocol
- `graphistry/compute/gfql/call_executor.py` - Fixed typing, removed getattr
- `mypy.ini` - Updated Python version to 3.10

## Notes
- Must use docker/ folder for tests per user instruction
- No type ignores allowed - must fix properly
- Keep changes minimal and focused
